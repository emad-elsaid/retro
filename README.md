## How it works

- A ruby server with Sinatra
- CSS with Bulma
- Saves all data in memory
- User can create board with name, max votes per user, columns names
- When the server needs the user to have identity it'll redirect him to set his username and assign uuid
- The board has a form to create a new card in each column
- Users can edit and delete boards
- Users can vote on cards

## Running the server

```
./server
```
Using Docker 

```
docker build -t retro .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 retro
